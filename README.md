# Travel Ideas

I have created this app to help me and my friends to plan future trips. In order to be able to create and update the list of trips, it's necessary to log in. Also, for each trip, someone who logged in, can leave a comment or review. 

Technologies used: 
* Node/Express/MongoDB
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
